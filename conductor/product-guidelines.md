# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Utility-focused**: The application and its documentation should use clear, concise, and direct language. Focus on providing actionable information and technical instructions without unnecessary fluff. The goal is to be a reliable and efficient tool for PT enthusiasts.

## Visual Identity
- **Material Design 3**: Adhere strictly to Google's Material Design 3 (M3) principles. This includes:
    - **Color Systems**: Utilizing dynamic color schemes where appropriate.
    - **Typography**: Using the standard M3 type scales for consistency.
    - **Components**: Employing standard M3 components (Buttons, Cards, Navigation Bars) to ensure a familiar and intuitive user experience.

## User Interface (UI) Principles
- **Legibility**: Prioritize high-contrast colors and clear typography to ensure the interface is readable in various lighting conditions, especially for mobile users outdoors.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: To keep the mobile interface clean, provide high-level summaries and hide complex technical details behind "View More" or "Settings" sections.
- **Mobile-First Interaction**:
    - **Touch Targets**: Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient size (at least 48x48dp) to be easily activated by touch.
    - **Gestures**: Utilize common mobile gestures (like swipe-to-action) to streamline frequent tasks.

## Content & Documentation
- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure all instructions, especially those regarding site adapters and downloaders, are technically precise.
- **Clarity over Brevity**: While being concise, never sacrifice clarity. If a process is complex, explain it clearly with step-by-step guidance.
